Hi, my name is [Harveen](https://twitter.com/harveenatwal_) and I built this thing. I'm a soloist who likes to build things, but have a bad habit of not building in public. While working on another project, [webtilities.com](https://webtilities.com), I thought about a vscode extension, which could help me automate the marketing bits. VoilÃ , PublicDev was born. I appreciate you taking the time to read my blurb. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harveenatwal_) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/harveenatwal/vscode-publicdev).
